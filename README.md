# pix
A Rust library for working with pixels and images.  It can perform fast alpha
compositing of a matte onto a destination image raster, using SIMD.

## Documentation

## Future Plans
Compositing two raster images, using the over operator is an important missing
feature.
Adding SIMD versions of pixel formats other than RGBA8 would be good.
